# noztr vs SDK Ownership Matrix

Canonical boundary guide for deciding what belongs in the `noztr` protocol kernel versus the
future higher-level SDK.

## Purpose

Use this matrix when:
- reviewing NIP scope in `noztr`
- deciding whether a proposed helper belongs in Layer 1
- planning SDK responsibilities
- challenging older scope decisions that may have been too narrow or too broad

This is not a replacement for the decision log. The decision log remains the canonical source for
accepted defaults and reversals. This matrix is the operational map that keeps `noztr` and the SDK
from drifting into each other.

## Boundary Rule

Put behavior in `noztr` only when it is all of:
- protocol-facing
- pure and deterministic
- bounded and static-capacity
- reusable across many callers
- directly about parse, validate, serialize, verify, or fixed-capacity reduction

Put behavior in the SDK when it involves any of:
- network fetches or relay orchestration
- session lifecycle or connection management
- redirect, launch, or UI handoff policy
- provider-specific availability, retries, or rate limits
- local stores, caches, or sync policy
- app-flow convenience that is not protocol-kernel reuse

## Review Questions

When a scope question comes up, answer these in order:
1. Is the behavior explicitly protocol-facing, or is it workflow around the protocol?
2. Can it be pure, deterministic, and fixed-capacity?
3. Would multiple SDK/app surfaces need the same logic?
4. Does putting it in `noztr` improve correctness or interoperability materially?
5. Would putting it in `noztr` pull in network, storage, UI, or policy concerns?

If the answer to `5` is yes, the behavior probably belongs in the SDK.

## NZDK Starter Priorities

- Start the SDK with the orchestration-heavy surfaces already intentionally left out of `noztr`:
  `NIP-46`, `NIP-39`, `NIP-29`, `NIP-17`, `NIP-03`, `NIP-11`, and `NIP-65`.
- Treat `NIP-44`, `NIP-59`, and `NIP-06` as foundational SDK dependencies rather than as the first
  UX-facing modules.
- Reuse `NIP-73` as the shared starter for any SDK support involving external identifiers or
  provider-specific presets.
- Keep SDK starter work honest: if a proposed helper stays pure, deterministic, bounded, and widely
  reusable, reconsider whether it should live in `noztr` instead.

## Borderline Accepted Kernel Helpers

- `NIP-39`
  - `identity_claim_build_proof_url(...)`
  - `identity_claim_build_expected_text(...)`
  - Current call: keep them in `noztr` for now as deterministic helper glue, but revisit when the
    SDK grows provider adapters because they are the clearest currently implemented
    provider-shaped helpers.
- `NIP-46`
  - `discovery_render_nostrconnect_url(...)`
  - Current call: keep it in `noztr` as exact protocol-facing placeholder substitution, not client
    orchestration; revisit only if SDK-side redirect/launch handling makes the helper redundant.
