# Decision Log

Immutable record of accepted planning decisions.

## Change Control

- Add new decisions; do not edit accepted decision payloads except typo-only fixes.
- If meaning changes, add a new decision ID and mark the old one superseded.
- Canonical payload must be self-contained in each decision entry.
- Do not rely on cross-file references as the only source for canonical fields.
- Required decision fields: Date, Status, Decision, Why, Tradeoff, Reversal Trigger.
- Traceability fields required: Related Tradeoff IDs, Supersedes.

## Phase Closure Evidence Rules

- Every closed phase must include one evidence record in this file.
- Evidence record fields: Phase, Closure Date, Gate Result, Ambiguity Snapshot,
  Decision-Needed Count (High Impact), Owner.
- Phase closure is invalid if high-impact `decision-needed` count is non-zero.

## D-001: Freeze parity source snapshots

- Date: 2026-03-04
- Status: accepted
- Decision: freeze the parity baseline on this exact snapshot set:
  - applesauce
    - repo: `git@github.com:hzrd149/applesauce.git`
    - local path: `/workspace/pkgs/applesauce`
    - commit: `5f152fc98e5baa97e8176e54ce9b9345976c8b32`
  - rust-nostr
    - repo: `git@github.com:rust-nostr/nostr.git`
    - local path: `/workspace/pkgs/nostr`
    - commit: `9bcc6cd779a7c6eb41509b37aee4575fa5ae47b9`
  - libnostr-z
    - repo: `git@github.com:privkeyio/libnostr-z.git`
    - local path: `/workspace/pkgs/libnostr-z`
    - commit: `a849dc804521801971f42d71c172aa681ecdc573`
  - pin date: `2026-03-04`
- Why: reproducible analysis across phased planning.
- Tradeoff: stale source risk versus reproducibility.
- Related Tradeoff: T-0-002.
- Reversal Trigger: parity analysis requires upstream changes not represented in
  pinned commits.
- Supersedes: none

## D-002: Define parity as behavior, not API shape

- Date: 2026-03-04
- Status: accepted
- Decision: parity means behavioral parity (parse, validate, serialize, verify,
  and tests), not API shape parity.
- Why: preserve Zig-native API quality and constraints.
- Tradeoff: adapter work versus cleaner long-term core API.
- Related Tradeoff: T-0-002.
- Reversal Trigger: explicit product requirement for source-compatible APIs.
- Supersedes: none

## D-003: Strict-by-default protocol policy

- Date: 2026-03-04
- Status: accepted
- Decision: strict parsing/validation by default; compatibility handling only by
  documented exception with tests.
- Why: deterministic behavior and lower safety risk.
- Tradeoff: reduced permissiveness versus clearer semantics.
- Related Tradeoff: T-0-001, T-0-003.
- Reversal Trigger: high-value interop blocked without broad compatibility mode.
- Supersedes: none

## D-004: Mandatory phase closure gate

- Date: 2026-03-04
- Status: accepted
- Decision: no phase closure without tradeoff records and ambiguity checkpoint.
- Why: prevent silent decision drift and late-stage rework.
- Tradeoff: more process overhead versus higher planning quality.
- Related Tradeoff: T-0-004.
- Reversal Trigger: demonstrated process bottleneck without quality benefits.
- Supersedes: none
